// Project Euler problem 4
// A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

// First I need to write a function to figure out if a number is a palindrome.
// Next I will need to get the products of all pairs of two 3-digit numbers
// Then I will need to check each product for whether it is a palindrome or not
