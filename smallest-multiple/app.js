// Project Euler #5
// 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
// What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

// obviously need a loop. Is it quicker to loop over an array of 1 - 20 or just to run a standard for loop?
// Can skip 1 and test for evenness for 2 so can start on 3
// Can elimanate numbers ending in anything other than a multiples of 20 (so advance 20 at a time)
